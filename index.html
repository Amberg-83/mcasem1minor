    <h1>Major Nuclear Accidents in History</h1>

    <p>
        Nuclear energy is one of the most powerful sources of electricity, but it comes
        with significant risks. Although nuclear accidents are extremely rare, the few
        that have occurred have resulted in environmental destruction, human casualties,
        and long-term contamination that lasts for decades. This project focuses on the
        two most severe nuclear disasters in human history: the Chernobyl Disaster of 1986
        and the Fukushima Daiichi Accident of 2011.
    </p>

    <p>
        The main objective of this project is to present an easy-to-understand visualization
        of how radioactive material spreads during a nuclear accident. Using the Gaussian Plume
        Model, we simulate how pollutants like Cesium-137 and Iodine-131 disperse into the
        atmosphere depending on wind speed, wind direction, and emission intensity.

    <p>
        Through interactive heatmaps and detailed case studies, this website allows users
        to explore the causes, impact, and consequences of these nuclear disasters. The maps
        included in each disaster page are generated using Python, NumPy, Folium, and environmental
        dispersion formulas commonly used in atmospheric research.

    <h2>Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster (Ukraine, 1986)</h2>

    <p>
        The explosion at Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl plant is considered the worst nuclear
        accident ever recorded. The reactor exploded during a safety test, releasing an enormous
        plume of radioactive material across Europe.
    </p>

    <h2>Fukushima Daiichi Accident (Japan, 2011)</h2>

    <p>
        Triggered by a massive earthquake and tsunami, the Fukushima accident caused the meltdown
        of three reactors, contaminating large portions of the Pacific Ocean and nearby land.
