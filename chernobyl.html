    <h2>Overview & Context</h2>

    <p>
      The Chernobyl disaster of April 26, 1986, is widely regarded as the worst nuclear accident in world history. 
      It occurred during a late-night safety test at Reactor No. 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, 
      which was then part of the Soviet Union. Due to a flawed reactor design and a series of operational mistakes, 
      operators disabled critical safety systems, causing a sudden and uncontrollable power surge. This led to a massive 
      steam explosion that destroyed the reactor core and blew off the thousand-ton concrete lid, releasing radioactive 
      material high into the atmosphere. Fires erupted across the facility, further accelerating the spread of radioactive dust.
    </p>

    <p>
      First responders, including firefighters and plant workers, were exposed to lethal doses of radiation within minutes 
      without being properly informed of the danger. The nearby town of Pripyat, home to nearly 50,000 people, continued 
      normal life for an entire day after the explosion because authorities delayed evacuation. Residents were finally 
      moved out 36 hours later, but thousands had already received significant exposure to radionuclides such as iodine-131 
      and cesium-137. Over the next weeks, dozens of workers died from acute radiation syndrome, and more than 100,000 people 
      from nearby regions were permanently relocated to create a 30-km exclusion zone.
    </p>

    <p>
      The environmental and long-term health impacts were severe. Radioactive contamination spread across Ukraine, Belarus, 
      Russia, and parts of Europe. Farmland, forests, and rivers absorbed high levels of radiation, and certain areas may 
      remain unsafe for centuries. Thousands of cases of thyroid cancer—especially among children—have been linked to the 
      radioactive iodine released during the disaster. Economically and socially, the accident caused immense disruption, 
      forcing communities to abandon homes, farms, and entire towns that now remain frozen in time. The psychological impact 
      of sudden displacement, fear, and isolation still affects survivors today.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the years that followed, Chernobyl became a global symbol of nuclear risk and the need for strict safety culture. 
      International agencies introduced stronger reactor design requirements, independent safety oversight, and mandatory stress tests. 
      The original concrete sarcophagus built in 1986 deteriorated quickly, leading to the construction of the New Safe Confinement, 
      completed in 2016, which is designed to seal the reactor for the next century. Today, Chernobyl stands not only as a 
      historical tragedy but also as a lesson for nations developing or operating nuclear power plants.
