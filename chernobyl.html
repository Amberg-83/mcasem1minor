    <h1>Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster (1986)</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        The Chernobyl disaster is considered the worst nuclear accident in the history of nuclear power.
        It occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Pripyat, Ukraine.
        A combination of design flaws and human error led to a catastrophic explosion in Reactor No. 4,
        which released massive amounts of radioactive material into the environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        The accident’s impact reached far beyond Ukraine. Radioactive clouds were carried across Europe,
        affecting Belarus, Russia, Scandinavia, and even parts of Western Europe. Over 350,000 people were
        evacuated from the most contaminated areas, leaving behind entire cities that remain abandoned even today.
    </p>

    <p>
        The disaster also triggered major global reforms in nuclear safety. Chernobyl became a turning point,
        forcing governments and nuclear agencies worldwide to adopt stricter regulations, emergency protocols,
        and modern reactor designs to prevent such a catastrophe from ever happening again.
    </p>

    <h2>Cause of Disaster</h2>
    <p>
        The accident occurred during a late-night safety test, where engineers attempted to simulate a power
        outage. Unfortunately, they disabled several critical safety systems. The flawed RBMK reactor design
        responded unpredictably at low power. A sudden power surge caused the reactor to explode, blowing apart
        the building and exposing the radioactive core.
    </p>

    <p>
        The explosion triggered a graphite fire that burned for 10 days, releasing radioactive fuel fragments
        and toxic isotopes into the atmosphere. First responders, including firefighters, rushed into the core
        area without proper protection, leading to severe radiation burns and deaths within days.
    </p>

    <h2>Deaths and Health Impact</h2>
    <p>
        The immediate death toll was 31, mostly plant workers and firefighters. Long-term effects are far more
        difficult to measure. Studies estimate that radiation exposure caused thousands of cancers, particularly
        thyroid cancer among children exposed to radioactive iodine. The region remains unsafe, and wildlife and
        vegetation continue to show signs of radiation effects.
    </p>

    <h2>Major Pollutants Released</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Iodine-131 (short-term thyroid risk)</li>
        <li>Cesium-137 (long-term contamination)</li>
        <li>Strontium-90</li>
        <li>Xenon-133</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Heatmap Simulation</h2>
    <p>
        The map below displays a simplified radioactive plume simulation based on wind direction and atmospheric
        dispersion patterns. Although not an exact historical model, it demonstrates how radioactive particles
        spread rapidly after the explosion.
