    <h2>Cause of Disaster</h2>
    <p>
        The Chernobyl disaster occurred on April 26, 1986, when Reactor 4 at the Chernobyl
        Nuclear Power Plant in northern Ukraine exploded during a late-night safety test.
        A combination of design flaws in the RBMK reactor and critical operator mistakes
        led to an uncontrollable surge of energy, causing a massive steam explosion followed
        by a nuclear fire that burned for 10 days.
    </p>

    <p>
        The explosion ejected radioactive material into the atmosphere, contaminating
        large parts of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. The Soviet Union initially attempted
        to hide the disaster, but radiation sensors in Sweden detected abnormal levels,
        forcing the government to acknowledge the accident publicly. The lack of immediate
        evacuation contributed to large-scale radiation exposure.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over 600,000 workers, known as “liquidators,” were involved in cleaning the
        surrounding area and constructing the original concrete sarcophagus around the
        reactor. The entire city of Pripyat was abandoned, creating one of the world’s
        most famous ghost towns. The disaster is considered the worst nuclear accident
        in history, classified as Level 7 on the INES scale.
    </p>

    <h2>Deaths</h2>
    <p>
        Immediate deaths: 31  
        Estimated long-term deaths (cancer): 4,000 to 30,000  
        Affected population: over 5 million people across Europe
    </p>

    <h2>Major Pollutants Released</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Iodine-131</li>
        <li>Cesium-137</li>
        <li>Strontium-90</li>
        <li>Plutonium isotopes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Radioactive Plume Heatmap</h2>
    <p>
        The heatmap below displays the estimated spread of radioactive material using a
        Gaussian Plume Model. This simulation illustrates how wind speed, direction,
        and emission strength affected the contamination pattern around Eastern Europe.
