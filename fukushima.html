<h2>Overview & Context</h2>
<p>
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster occurred on 11 March 2011 following a magnitude-9.0 earthquake off the northeastern coast of Japan and the massive tsunami that followed. Although the nuclear reactors shut down automatically after the earthquake, the tsunami flooded the plant’s protective seawalls and disabled critical electrical systems. Backup diesel generators and power distribution systems were submerged, resulting in a complete loss of cooling capability. Without cooling, nuclear fuel overheated rapidly, creating a dangerous situation within hours. The accident demonstrated how natural disasters can lead to cascading technological failures when safety systems are not designed for extreme events.
</p>

<h2>Causes of the Disaster</h2>
<p>
The primary cause of the Fukushima disaster was the combination of an extreme natural event and inadequate disaster preparedness. The tsunami generated by the earthquake exceeded the design assumptions used during plant construction. Protective barriers were insufficient, and critical emergency power systems were located in flood-prone areas. Poor risk assessment, underestimation of worst-case scenarios, and insufficient emergency planning contributed significantly to the severity of the accident. Organizational and regulatory weaknesses also delayed effective responses, allowing the situation to worsen. The disaster highlighted the importance of designing nuclear facilities to withstand rare but high-impact natural hazards.
</p>

<h2>Technical Failure Mechanism</h2>
<p>
Technically, the accident resulted from a complete loss of electrical power, known as station blackout. Without power, cooling pumps could not circulate water to remove residual heat from the reactor cores. As water levels fell, fuel rods became exposed, leading to extreme temperature increases. Chemical reactions between zirconium fuel cladding and steam generated large volumes of hydrogen gas. Hydrogen accumulated inside reactor buildings and eventually exploded, damaging containment structures. These explosions allowed radioactive materials to escape into the environment, compounding the technical and safety challenges faced during emergency response efforts.
</p>

<h2>Impacts of the Disaster</h2>
<p>
In the short term, the Fukushima disaster led to the evacuation of more than 150,000 residents from surrounding areas, disrupting communities and livelihoods. Economic activity in agriculture, fishing, and industry was severely affected. Long-term impacts include environmental contamination, psychological stress among displaced populations, and prolonged social uncertainty. Decommissioning the damaged reactors is expected to take several decades, requiring large financial investments and advanced technology. The accident also influenced global nuclear energy policies, causing several countries to reassess or delay nuclear power programs.
</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>
The Fukushima disaster emphasized several critical lessons for nuclear safety worldwide. Facilities must be designed with multiple layers of redundant protection against extreme natural events. Emergency power and cooling systems should remain functional under severe conditions. Transparent communication, effective evacuation planning, and coordinated disaster management are essential for minimizing harm. Additionally, continuous risk evaluation and safety upgrades are necessary as environmental and technological conditions evolve. Fukushima demonstrated that even advanced nations must remain vigilant against low-probability but high-consequence events in nuclear operations.
