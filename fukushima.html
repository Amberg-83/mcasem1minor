    <h1>Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster (2011)</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster occurred on March 11, 2011, after a powerful 9.0 magnitude
        earthquake struck Japan. The earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that overwhelmed the coastal
        defenses of the nuclear power plant, cutting off power and disabling critical cooling systems in
        three reactors. This led to core meltdowns, hydrogen explosions, and the release of radioactive
        material into the air and sea.
    </p>

    <p>
        The disaster was the largest nuclear crisis since Chernobyl and exposed weaknesses in nuclear plant
        design, emergency planning, and tsunami protection. Japan was forced to evacuate more than 150,000
        residents from the surrounding areas.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fukushima also had long-lasting social and economic impacts. Thousands of residents lost their homes,
        farmlands were contaminated, and fishing industries suffered due to radioactive ocean discharge.
        Cleanup and decommissioning efforts are still ongoing and are expected to continue for decades.
    </p>

    <h2>Cause of Disaster</h2>
    <p>
        Although the reactors automatically shut down during the earthquake, the real problem began when the
        tsunami flooded the plant. Backup generators located in low-lying areas were destroyed, leaving no
        electricity to run the cooling pumps. Without cooling, the reactor cores overheated and melted down.
    </p>

    <p>
        Multiple hydrogen explosions damaged the outer buildings, spreading radioactive dust into the
        atmosphere. Unlike Chernobyl, the containment structures remained mostly intact, preventing a larger
        release, but the damage was still significant.
    </p>

    <h2>Deaths and Health Effects</h2>
    <p>
        There were no immediate radiation deaths. However, over 1,000 people died indirectly due to evacuation
        stress, disruption of medical treatment, and long-term psychological trauma. Radiation exposure among
        the public remained relatively low due to rapid evacuation.
    </p>

    <h2>Major Pollutants Released</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cesium-134</li>
        <li>Cesium-137</li>
        <li>Iodine-131</li>
        <li>Contaminated seawater (treated but released over years)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Heatmap Simulation</h2>
    <p>
        The following map displays a simplified plume model showing how radioactive elements may have dispersed
        from the Fukushima reactors in the days following the tsunami. Wind direction, speed, and atmospheric
        turbulence strongly influence the spread.
