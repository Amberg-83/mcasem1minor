    <h2>Overview & Context</h2>

    <p>
      The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster occurred on March 11, 2011, after one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded struck off Japan’s northeastern coast. 
      The resulting tsunami overwhelmed the plant’s seawall, flooding backup generators and disabling the cooling systems. Although the reactors shut down automatically 
      during the earthquake, the loss of power prevented circulation of coolant water, leading to dangerous overheating of the fuel rods. Within hours, the situation 
      escalated, and over the next few days, three reactors experienced partial meltdowns. The hydrogen produced by the overheated fuel caused large explosions that 
      severely damaged the facility, releasing radioactive materials into the air and ocean.
    </p>

    <p>
      Japanese authorities quickly ordered mass evacuations from nearby towns and villages, ultimately displacing more than 150,000 people. Many were forced to leave 
      behind belongings, homes, and family property without knowing whether they would ever return. Although radiation exposure levels were significantly lower than 
      those in Chernobyl, the disaster created widespread psychological and social distress. Families were separated, industries halted, and the region experienced long-term 
      economic disruption. Some residents were unable to return for years due to contamination and fear, while others have permanently resettled elsewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Environmental impacts of the accident remain a concern. Large amounts of radioactive contamination entered local soil and water bodies, prompting one of the largest 
      decontamination efforts in Japan’s history. Millions of tons of contaminated soil were collected and stored in secure facilities. The handling of radioactive wastewater 
      used to cool the damaged reactors has been among the most debated issues. Japan implemented multi-stage filtration to reduce radioactive content and has begun releasing 
      treated water into the Pacific Ocean under international supervision. Despite safety assurances, the issue continues to spark global debate and public concern.
    </p>

    <p>
      More than a decade later, the Fukushima site remains in a long-term decommissioning phase that could span 30 to 40 years. Removing the melted fuel debris is considered 
      one of the most difficult engineering tasks ever attempted in nuclear history. The disaster prompted countries around the world to reassess nuclear safety practices, 
      leading to stronger coastal protection, improved emergency protocols, and enhanced operator training. Fukushima stands as a reminder of how natural disasters can 
      trigger complex technological emergencies and underscores the importance of preparedness, transparency, and robust engineering design.
