    <h2>Cause of Disaster</h2>

    <p>
        The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident occurred on March 11, 2011, after a massive
        9.0 magnitude earthquake struck the northeastern coast of Japan. The earthquake triggered
        a powerful tsunami with waves reaching up to 15 meters high, overwhelming the plant’s
        seawall and flooding the emergency generators. As a result, the cooling systems failed,
        leading to overheating and the meltdown of three reactors.
    </p>

    <p>
        The loss of electrical power—both external grid power and internal backup generators—
        caused the nuclear fuel rods to heat uncontrollably. Hydrogen gas built up inside the reactor units,
        resulting in a series of explosions that damaged the reactor buildings. The failure to maintain
        cooling allowed radioactive materials to escape into the atmosphere and surrounding seawater,
        creating long-term contamination.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although the plant workers, known as the “Fukushima 50,” worked tirelessly to contain the situation,
        the event became one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. The Japanese government declared
        a nuclear emergency and evacuated more than 160,000 people from the region, many of whom could
        not return even years later due to radioactive contamination.
    </p>

    <h2>Deaths</h2>
    <p>
        Immediate radiation deaths: 0  
        Indirect disaster-related deaths (evacuation stress, delayed medical care): 1,000+  
        Long-term radiation-related deaths remain under study.
    </p>

    <h2>Major Pollutants Released</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cesium-134</li>
        <li>Cesium-137</li>
        <li>Iodine-131</li>
        <li>Strontium-90 (trace amounts)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Radioactive Plume Heatmap</h2>
    <p>
        The heatmap below shows the simulated dispersion of radioactive pollutants using the Gaussian
        Plume Model. This model estimates how radiation spreads into the atmosphere based on wind
        speed, wind direction, emission strength, and release height.
