<h1>FUKUSHIMA DAIICHI — 2011</h1>

<h2>Overview & Context</h2>
<p>
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster occurred on 11 March 2011 after a magnitude-9.0 earthquake struck off the northeastern coast of Japan, followed by a massive tsunami. Although the reactors shut down automatically, the tsunami flooded protective seawalls and disabled electrical infrastructure. Backup diesel generators supplying emergency power were submerged, causing a complete loss of cooling capability. As residual heat from nuclear fuel could not be removed, temperatures inside the reactor cores rapidly increased. This chain of failures demonstrated how natural disasters can trigger severe technological emergencies when design limits are exceeded.
</p>

<h2>Causes of the Disaster</h2>
<p>
The primary cause of the Fukushima disaster was the underestimation of extreme natural hazards during plant design. The tsunami exceeded safety assumptions and rendered protective systems ineffective. Critical emergency power equipment was placed at low elevations vulnerable to flooding. Additionally, risk assessments failed to consider combined earthquake-tsunami scenarios. Organizational and regulatory shortcomings delayed effective decision-making during the early stages of the crisis. These factors together transformed a natural disaster into a nuclear accident, highlighting the importance of conservative design and comprehensive hazard planning.
</p>

<h2>Technical Failure Mechanism</h2>
<p>
The accident was triggered by a station blackout, where all electrical power sources were lost. Without power, cooling pumps could not circulate coolant water. As water levels dropped, nuclear fuel rods became exposed and overheated. Reactions between zirconium cladding and steam produced hydrogen gas, which accumulated inside reactor buildings. Hydrogen explosions damaged structural barriers and allowed radioactive material to escape. These technical failures severely complicated emergency operations and intensified radiation release into the surrounding environment.
</p>

<h2>Impacts of the Disaster</h2>
<p>
In the immediate aftermath, over 150,000 residents were evacuated from surrounding regions, resulting in major social and economic disruption. Agricultural land, fisheries, and industries were affected, causing long-term financial losses. Environmental contamination required large-scale decontamination efforts. Even years later, psychological stress, loss of community identity, and uncertainty about health impacts continued to affect displaced populations. The decommissioning and cleanup process is expected to take several decades, making Fukushima one of the most complex nuclear recovery efforts in history.
</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>
Fukushima emphasized the need for robust nuclear safety culture and preparation for extreme events beyond historical records. Facilities must incorporate multiple layers of protection, redundant cooling systems, and power-independent safety mechanisms. Transparent communication, rapid evacuation planning, and coordination among authorities are essential during emergencies. Continuous reassessment of risk models and regular safety upgrades are necessary to maintain long-term operational safety. The disaster reshaped global nuclear regulations and reinforced the importance of resilience in critical infrastructure.
